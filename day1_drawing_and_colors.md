## Introduction
Every wanted to make a game? In the next three lessons we will cover the basics to make a simple click game.  
While this seems like a simple game, it will have all the elements of a game and hopefully we will be able to get far enough that you will be able to improve upon it.

Today we cover how to make things appear in your game.  We will cover the basics of position, drawing, and colors.  

You will use your skills to make a character like this.  Along the way, we will cover important topics such as the color types and how to position shapes.

## Instructions
### Getting Started
1. Goto the link [https://editor.p5js.org/](https://editor.p5js.org/)
2. Select `Sign up` in the top right corner.
3. Have your STEAM Academy partner `login` or `sign up` to make sure your work is not lost.
4. You should have something that looks like this (hover over the images to see): <img class = "instruction_img" src = "img/1_4.png">   
  - The play button runs your program.
  - The setup function runs once at the beginning.
  - The draw function runs over and over 60 frames per seconds.  
5. Press play and you should see in the preview section a grey rectangle.  
### Hello World!
By tradition, the first thing you should do in a new coding language is say "Hello World!".
1. Click on the end of line 6 and press `enter`. Type in the command `text("Hello World!", 100, 100 );`  
2. Press play.  
You should notice a couple of things.
