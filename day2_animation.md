### Introduction
Animation is an important part in game design. Without animation, everything looks incomplete and boring. Animation is essentially movement of one or more objects to make everything look smoother or have a certain style that you want.  

Today we are going to be going over moving a shape and some of the logic behind it.
### Instructions
First you want to decide what you want to do with a shape, so you can create the appropriate [variable(s)](#variables) for the animation. Once you have decided what you want to happen to the shape, create a variable that you can assign to the shape, so you can change something about it that fits your needs.












#### Variables
    *A variable is a value stored in a seperate location than where it's used. It is made to be used in multiple spots at once (making code easier to read and write), and changing the variable changes the value in every spot it's used, instead of changing multiple spots one by one.
